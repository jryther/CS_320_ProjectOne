Below are the journal questions required for CS-320

-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Software is never completely secure but testers can use a variety of methods to try and test the most important aspects that the budget and timetables allow.  Creating tables and charts that detail the requirements and design of the system are great ways to verify there are no fundamental flaws in the architecture of the system.  Static testing techniques such as code coverage gives testers an idea of how much of the program their tests cover.  Unit tests allow testers to create test cases before or after the program is created to verify that expected outcomes occur.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Requirement documents are essential to the design and testing of a system.  By listing and categorizing the requirements testers can create specific test cases to verify that they continue to be met over the lifecycle of the project.  Reviews are also essential to make sure the creators do not introduce bias in the design.

-How do I approach designing software?

Since starting this course I have a new outlook on how to create good software.  Software should be designed from the start with testing in mind.  By creating system specifications that can be reviewed and anylized I can make sure that the premise and structure is not flawed before coding begins.  Unit tests should then be made after completion of each piece of the program and not just at the end of the SDLC.
